# Sometimes we have to repeat the statement that is if we want to print number from 1 to 100

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)  # we can do but it will take time

# So, we use loops:
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)
 

 # two types of loop
'''1. for loop
   2. while loop'''
