# A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tuple, or string

for i in range (4): # rage function will give 0 to n-1 number
    print(i)
    
# Range function in python is used to generated a sequence of number, we can specify start,stop, and step-size
 #Step-size:  is(1,100,4) it will execute 1 to 100 in difference of 4 like 0,4,8,12,
